## User Story
> AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform  
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API  
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem 

## Criteria
 > GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state  
WHEN I review the appâ€™s store  
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API  
WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store  
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider  
WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state  
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API  
WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store  
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API  
WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions  
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
